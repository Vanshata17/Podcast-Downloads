# Podcast-Downloads
Hi in this project I have downloaded and transcribed the podcasts which are taken from google podcasts. Used RSS feed and beautiful soup for extraction of the title and description. Downloaded 5 podcasts using for loop. For transcription, I have used assembly AI Created an API key and saved it in environment variable. (The environment variable is not displayed in the code for security purposes).
